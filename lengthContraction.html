<p>This is a simple representaion of the view of a spaceship being affected by length contraction. Length contraction can be seen from a staionary reference frame when an object is moving at a speed that is near the speed of light. When the stationary reference frame meassures the length of the moving object it has to meassure both ends at the same time. In order to do this the time of the point of the object further away from the stationary reference frame must be reduced to the same as the time of the closer point. This reduction of time causes a reduction of the percieved length.</p>
<p>The way that this representaiton works is it calculates the length contraction based on a velocity meassured from a stationary reference point and the length of a moving object as meassured from that object. These are plugged into the equation Observed Length = L * the square root of (1 - (V^2 / the speed of light ^2)). The units used are meters for length and meters/seconds for velocity. In order to change the length and velocity click one of the buttons and then enter a valid number into the prompt that comes up. After entering a new value the object will adjust to it. The length of the object is the length obsered by the stationary reference frame in viewport widths. Viewport widths are units used in HTML and CSS, and are each equal to 1% of the width of the web page. So if the observed length is 50 meters, then the object will take up about 50% of the width of the page. It is not exactly 50% though, as the border of the object take up more space.
